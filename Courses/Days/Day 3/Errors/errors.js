// What is Errors? 
// Errors in programming refer to issues or defects that arise within the program, resulting in abnormal behavior. 
// Even experienced developers can make these mistakes, which are also referred to as bugs or faults. 
// The process of eliminating these errors is called debugging. 
// These errors in Programming can be identified during the program’s compilation or execution, and it’s crucial to remove them to ensure the program runs smoothly. 
// Here we will discuss the various types of errors in programming and some of the common causes behind them. 
// So, let’s dive straight into the topic of Types of Errors in Programming.


// What are the Different Types of Errors in Programming?
// As mentioned above errors refers to issues that occur in a program that results in unwanted behavior of the program. 
// Some common Types of Errors in Programming are listed below.


// Syntax Error
// A syntax error is the most common type of error in programming. 
// It occurs when the programmer writes code that is not in accordance with the syntax of the programming language. 
// Syntax errors are detected by the compiler, and the compiler reports an error message to the programmer.


// Run-time Error
// A run-time error occurs during the execution of a program. 
// These errors occur when a program tries to perform an illegal operation, such as dividing by zero or attempting to access an invalid memory address. 
// The program compiles without errors, but when it runs, it encounters an error that causes it to terminate abnormally. 
// Run-time errors are often difficult to detect because they do not show up until the program is executed.


//  Logical Error
//  A logical error occurs when the program compiles and runs without any syntax, run-time, or linker errors, but the output is incorrect.
//  These errors occur when the program's logic or algorithms are incorrect. 
//  Logical errors are challenging to detect because the program does not generate any error messages.


// Semantic Error
// Semantic errors are errors that occur when the code written by the programmer makes no sense to the compiler, even though it is syntactically correct. 
// They are different from syntax errors, which indicate errors in the structure of the program, as semantic errors are related to the meaning and implementation of the program.


// Linker Error
// A linker error occurs when a program references a function or variable that is not defined in the program or the libraries it is linked against.
// Linker errors typically occur when a program is compiled and linked. The linker will report an error if it cannot find the necessary files or libraries to link the program.
