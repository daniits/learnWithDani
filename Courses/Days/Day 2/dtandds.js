// Data Types & Data Structure
// Programming languages all have built-in data structures, but these often differ from one language to another.

// What is Data Type? 
// In JavaScript, data types and data structures play a fundamental role in how information is stored, accessed, and manipulated. 
// JavaScript Has Two Main Data Type: 

// Primitive Data Types 
// These are MOst Basic Data Type 

// Number: Represents numeric values (both integers and floating-point numbers).
let age = 25; // 25 is Number 
let pi = 3.14159; // 3.14159 is also data type is number

// String: Represents a sequence of characters (text).
let name = "John Doe"; // John Doe is String

// Boolean: Represents logical values, either true or false.
let isJavaScriptFun = true; // It will be True or False Values

// Null: Represents the intentional absence of a value. It is treated as an object but is a primitive.
let noValue = null;

// Undefined: Indicates a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
let undefinedVariable;

// Symbol: Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), it represents a unique identifier, often used for object properties.
let symbol1 = Symbol('unique');

// BigInt: Introduced in ES2020, it is used for working with large integers beyond the safe limit of Number.
let bigNumber = BigInt(9007199254740991);


// Non Premative Data Type
// These are mutable and can hold collections of data or more complex entities.

// Object: A collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings or symbols and values can be any data type.
let person = { name: "John", age: 30 };

// Array: A special type of object used to store ordered collections of items (elements).
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

// Function: A reusable block of code that can be called with arguments to perform a task.
function greet() { return "Hello!"; }
