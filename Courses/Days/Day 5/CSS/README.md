Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are used to style elements based on their state or position within the document.

Example:
:hover
:nth-child()
:first-child

Pseudo-elements allow you to style specific parts of an element, such as the first letter or first line, or to insert content before or after an element.
Example: 
::before
::after
::first-letter
::first-line
